## Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression on Weather Prediction Dataset



### Overview of the Project

**Name:** AMAN <br>
**Company:** CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS <br>
**ID:** CT08DS3106 <br>
**Domain:** Data Science <br>
**Duration:** June 25, 2024 to July 25, 2024 <br>
**Mentor:** Harish Neelam

### Objective

The objective of this project is to make a predictive model which uses linear regression on a dataset containing data of weather conditions over seattle. The aim is to develop a model that can predict various aspects of weather using minimum temperature as input.

### Key Activities

- **Data Cleaning:** Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating visualizations to understand data distributions, trends, and relationships.
- **Model Building and Training:** Building a model and training it on the given data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluading the performance of the model to analyze its efficiency and accuracy in making predictions.

### Technologies used
- **Python**: The primary programming labguage for data science.
- **pandas**: Used for manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Used for manipulating arrays
- **matplotlib**: Employed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn**: Utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.
- **sklearn**: Used for the model building, training and evaluating tasks.

### Key Insights
- **Predicted Maximum Temprature vs Minimum Temprature**: Maximum Temprature is increasing with increase in minimum temprature.
- **Predicted Precipitation vs Minimum Temprature**: Amount of Precipitation is decreasing with increase in minimum temprature.
- **Predicted Wind Speed vs Minimum Temprature**: Wind Speed is decreasing with increase in minimum temprature.

### Predictive Model
- **Model Type**: This project uses both linear regression. Linear regession model predicts continuous data.
- **Model Performance**: Linear regression model shows very good performance with very low error values in different parameters of evaluation.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of model making process for weather prediction. These models are useful for descision making.
